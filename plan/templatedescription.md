A modern Three.js prototyping template built with TypeScript + Vite featuring a clean class-based architecture. The main ThreeApp class in src/main.ts orchestrates the 3D application, with modular utilities for scene creation (scene.ts), input handling (controls.ts), and responsive design (utils/resize.ts). It uses Three.js v0.160+ with proper TypeScript typing, includes built-in mouse/touch controls, automatic window resizing, and follows memory management best practices with disposal patterns. The template provides a solid foundation with basic lighting, shadows, and a rotating cube demo, while being easily extensible for new features like model loading, orbit controls, or post-processing effects. Development uses Vite's fast HMR and the build system handles optimization automatically.
