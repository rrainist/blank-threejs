# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started - This is YOUR Game Now!

**IMPORTANT**: This template is a starting point, not a rigid framework. Feel free to:

- Delete anything and start fresh
- Modify or replace any systems that don't fit your needs
- Add new systems and utilities as needed
- Change the architecture to match your game's requirements

Think of this as a minimal foundation for Three.js games - it shows you the basics, but you're meant to build something entirely different on top of it.

## Commands

### Development

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - TypeScript check and production build to `dist/`
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts          # Entry point - initializes Three.js and Game
â”œâ”€â”€ Game.ts          # Main game class - handles game logic
â”œâ”€â”€ Level.ts         # Level creation and layout
â”œâ”€â”€ scene.ts         # Basic Three.js scene setup
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/       # Game constants and configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ entities/        # Game entities (Player, Enemy, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ systems/         # Core systems (physics, input, etc.)
â””â”€â”€ utils/           # Utility classes and helpers
```

## Simplified Architecture

This template has been simplified to focus on the essentials:

### Core Systems

#### GameManager

Simple game state management:

- Game states (menu, playing, paused, game over)
- Score and lives tracking
- State change callbacks

```typescript
const gameManager = GameManager.getInstance();
gameManager.changeState(GameState.PLAYING);
gameManager.addScore(100);
```

#### InputManager

Direct keyboard and mouse input:

- No complex action mapping
- Simple key state checking
- Mouse position and clicks

```typescript
const input = InputManager.getInstance();
if (input.isKeyDown("w")) player.moveForward();
if (input.isMouseButtonJustPressed(0)) player.shoot();
const movement = input.getMovementVector(); // WASD normalized
```

#### CameraController

Single follow camera with mouse rotation:

- Third-person view only
- Right-click drag to rotate
- No collision detection

```typescript
const camera = CameraController.getInstance();
camera.setTarget(player);
```

#### PhysicsSystem

Cannon-es physics (kept for good game feel):

- Simple collision detection
- Gravity and forces
- Ground detection for jumping

```typescript
const physics = PhysicsSystem.getInstance();
const body = physics.createRigidBody(player, {
  shape: CollisionShape.CAPSULE,
  mass: 1,
});
```

#### EffectsSystem

Particle effects only:

- Spawn particles at positions
- Pre-made explosion and sparkle effects
- Object pooled for performance

```typescript
const effects = EffectsSystem.getInstance();
effects.explosion(position, { color: 0xff0000 });
effects.sparkle(collectible.position);
```

#### AudioManager

Simple 2D audio playback:

- Load and play sounds
- Master volume control
- Mute functionality

```typescript
const audio = AudioManager.getInstance();
audio.play2D("jump", { volume: 0.5 });
```

### Game Structure

#### main.ts

- Initializes Three.js (scene, camera, renderer)
- Creates Game instance
- Handles animation loop and resize

#### Game.ts

- Main game logic
- Entity management
- Collision detection
- Level loading

#### Level.ts

- Creates level geometry programmatically
- No JSON loading - all in code
- Two example levels (city and forest themed)

### Entities

#### Player

- Simple capsule shape
- WASD movement
- Space to jump
- Click to shoot

#### Enemy

- Single enemy type
- Follows player when in range
- Simple AI behavior

#### Collectible

- Floating, rotating items
- Gives points when collected
- Object pooled

#### Bullet

- Simple projectile
- Object pooled
- Damages enemies on hit

## Creating Your Game

### Starting Fresh

1. **Keep What You Need**: This template provides basics - keep only what helps
2. **Delete Freely**: Remove any systems or entities you don't need
3. **Build Your Vision**: Add your own game-specific features

### Common Patterns

#### Creating a New Entity

```typescript
export class MyEntity extends THREE.Group {
  constructor() {
    super();

    // Create mesh
    const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
    const material = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
    this.mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
    this.add(this.mesh);

    // Set user data
    this.userData.type = "myEntity";
  }

  update(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic
    this.rotation.y += deltaTime;
  }
}
```

#### Adding Physics

```typescript
const physics = PhysicsSystem.getInstance();
physics.createRigidBody(entity, {
  shape: CollisionShape.BOX,
  mass: 1,
  collisionGroup: PhysicsSystem.COLLISION_GROUP.DEFAULT,
});
```

#### Handling Input

```typescript
const input = InputManager.getInstance();

// In update loop
if (input.isKeyDown("Space")) {
  // Jump
}

const movement = input.getMovementVector();
player.move(movement.x, movement.y);
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Get basic gameplay working first
2. **Iterate Quickly**: Test often, refine constantly
3. **Use the Console**: `logger.info()` is your friend
4. **Profile Performance**: Keep an eye on FPS
5. **Have Fun**: This is your game - make it awesome!

## What Was Removed

To keep things simple, we removed:

- Multiple camera modes and switching
- Complex input action/axis mapping system
- Configuration management system
- Scene management system
- JSON level loading
- Save/load functionality
- Multiple enemy types
- Gamepad support
- Complex health/damage systems

You can always add these back if your game needs them!

## Quick Reference

### Essential Imports

```typescript
import * as THREE from "three";
import { GameManager, GameState } from "./systems/GameManager";
import { InputManager } from "./systems/InputManager";
import { PhysicsSystem } from "./systems/PhysicsSystem";
import { EffectsSystem } from "./systems/EffectsSystem";
import { AudioManager } from "./systems/AudioManager";
import { eventBus, GameEvents } from "./utils/EventBus";
import { logger } from "./utils/Logger";
```

### Common Events

- `GameEvents.PLAYER_DEATH`
- `GameEvents.PLAYER_DAMAGE`
- `GameEvents.ENEMY_DEATH`
- `GameEvents.ITEM_COLLECT`
- `GameEvents.GAME_OVER`

### Input Keys

- WASD or Arrow Keys - Movement
- Space - Jump
- Left Click - Shoot
- Right Click + Drag - Rotate camera
- P - Pause
- M - Mute

Remember: This is just a starting point. The best game is the one you create!
